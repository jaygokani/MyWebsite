Here is all you need to know about relative file paths:

Starting with / returns to the root directory and starts there

Starting with ../ moves one directory backward and starts there

Starting with ../../ moves two directories backward and starts there (and so on...)

To move forward, just start with the first sub directory and keep moving forward.
